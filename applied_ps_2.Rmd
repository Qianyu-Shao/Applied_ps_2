# Problems
## Part 1
###  Read in one percent sample 

```{r}
start.time <- Sys.time()
pt <- read.csv("parking_tickets_one_percent.csv")
end.time <- Sys.time()
end.time-start.time

library(testthat)
test_that('row numbers correct', {
    expect_equal(nrow(pt), 287458)
})
```
2.
```{r}
file.info("parking_tickets_one_percent.csv")
83942807/1048576
```

The file is 80.0541 megabytes. Given that this is only the sample containing ticket numbers that end in 01, which is generally 1/100 of full data set. The size of full data set might be 8005.41M.

3.
It's ordered by issue date.

4.
```{r}

pt %>% summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.))))
#from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24027605/determine-the-number-of-na-values-in-a-column

```

5.
The top three variables with most missing values are zipcode, hearing disposition and 
notice level. Some of them having "Define" under variable ticket_queue, which means city cannot identify the vehicle owner, thus zipcode, hearing disposition and 
notice level are all can't be obtained in this circumstance. Also, variable hearing disposition is blank unless the ticket was contested.

## Cleaning the data and benchmarking

1. 
22364 tickets were issued in 2017, which implies around 2236400 tickets were isuued in total. According to ProPublica,the City of Chicago issues more than 3 million tickets each year. I think this is meaningful as being interpreted as that picking tickets ending with 01 is not so representative for full data set.
```{r}
pt <- pt %>%
  mutate(year = str_extract(issue_date, "\\d{1,4}"))
pt %>%
  filter(year == "2017") %>%
  nrow()


```

2.

```{r}
pt %>% 
  group_by(violation_description) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = violation_description, y = n)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  coord_flip()

```


## Joins - unit

1. 
29 rows have missing data for Unit.

2.
There are 385 units in unit_key.
```{r}
uk <- read.csv("unit_key.csv",encoding = "UTF-8")
uk <- uk %>% 
  rename(unit = X.U.FEFF.Reporting.District) 
uk %>%
  count(unit) %>%
  nrow()
  
```




3.
287429 rows in tickets are matched,
29 rows in tickets are unmatched.
128 rows in unit_key are matched,
257 rows are not.
```{r}
pt <- pt %>% 
  mutate(unit=as.character(unit)) %>%
  left_join(uk, by = "unit") 

pt1 <- pt %>% 
  mutate(unit=as.character(unit)) %>%
  full_join(uk, by = "unit") 

287715-287458
sum(is.na(uk$Department.Name))

```


4.

DOF issued more tickets.
1160 N. Larrabee, 6464 N. Clark, OEMC, 3315 W. Ogden, 5555 W. Grand are the top 5 deparments under CPO issued the most tickets.
```{r}
pt %>% count(unit_description) %>% arrange(-n)
pt %>% 
  count(unit_description, Department.Description,sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(8)

```


## Joins - ZIP code 

1.
```{r}
zip <- read.csv("chi_zips.csv",encoding="UTF-8")
zip <- zip %>% rename(zipcode=X.U.FEFF.ZIP) %>%
  mutate(zipcode=as.character(zipcode))

library(tidycensus)
ACS_VARS_18<-load_variables(2018,"acs5",cache=TRUE)

acs_data<-get_acs(
  geography = "zcta",
  variables=c("B01003_001","B02001_003","B06011_001"),
  year=2018,
  state = "IL"
)

acs_data <- acs_data %>%
  select(-moe) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = estimate) %>%
  rename(population=B01003_001,
         race=B02001_003,
         median_income=B06011_001) %>%
  filter(!is.na(population)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(race)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(median_income))
  
pt <- pt %>% 
  mutate(zipcode = str_extract(zipcode, "\\d{1,5}")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(zipcode)) %>%
  left_join(acs_data, by = c("zipcode"="GEOID"))

pt %>%
  filter(ticket_queue!="paid") %>%
  filter(!is.na(population)) %>%
  count(population, zipcode) %>%
  mutate(unpaid = n/population) %>%
  arrange(-unpaid) %>%
  head(3)


```


4.
```{r}
zip_unpaid <- pt %>%
  filter(ticket_queue!="paid") %>%
  filter(!is.na(population)) %>%
  count(population, zipcode) %>%
  mutate(unpaid = n/population)

map<-get_acs(
  geography = "zcta",
  variables=c("B01003_001","B02001_003","B06011_001"),
  year=2018,
  state = "IL", 
  geometry=TRUE
  ) %>% 
  inner_join(zip_unpaid, by = c("GEOID"="zipcode")) %>%
  inner_join(zip, by = c("GEOID"="zipcode")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(unpaid)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill=unpaid, color=unpaid))+
  geom_sf()+
  labs(title = "",
       caption="")
map
```



# Part II
## Understanding the structure of the data
1.
```{r}
fine <- pt %>%
  filter(fine_level2_amount<2*fine_level1_amount) %>%
  count(violation_code) %>%
  filter(n>100)
fine
pt %>%
  filter(violation_code %in% fine$violation_code) %>%
  mutate(unpaid_increase = fine_level2_amount-fine_level1_amount) %>%
  count(violation_code,violation_description,unpaid_increase)
  
  
```


2.
```{r}
 knitr::include_graphics("graph.png")
```

3.
```{r}
vd <- pt %>%
  count(violation_description,violation_code) %>%
  count(violation_description) %>%
  filter(n>1)

pt %>%
  filter(violation_description %in% vd$violation_description) %>%
  count(violation_description, violation_code)

```

4.
```{r}
vc <- pt %>%
  count(violation_description,violation_code) %>%
  count(violation_code) %>%
  filter(n>1)
pt %>%
  filter(violation_code %in% vc$violation_code) %>%
  count(violation_code, violation_description)


```

5.
For example, "EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION" and "EXPIRED PLATE OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION" have different violation_code.

```{r}
vd50 <- pt %>%
  count(violation_description, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(50)

pt %>% 
  filter(violation_description %in% vd50$violation_description) %>%
  count(violation_description,violation_code)
```

## Revenue increase from “missing city sticker” tickets 

1.
The new code is "0964125B", the old is "0964125" and "0976170".
The intial cost is 200 and 120.
```{r}
pt %>%
  mutate(sticker=str_extract(pt$violation_description, ".STICKER.")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(sticker)) %>%
  select(violation_description, violation_code, fine_level1_amount,year) %>%
  count(violation_description, violation_code, fine_level1_amount,year)

```



2.
There is no obvious trend for number of missing sticker tickets over years. They keep around 2000 per year.
```{r}
pt %>%
  mutate(sticker=str_extract(pt$violation_description, ".STICKER.")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(sticker)) %>%
  select(violation_description, violation_code, fine_level1_amount,year) %>%
  count(year)
```

3.
Maybe 2012-02-25.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

pt %>%
  filter(violation_code == "0964125B") %>%
  select(issue_date) %>%
  arrange() %>%
  head(1)
  
```

4.
It should have been 10 million.
```{r}
revenue_2011 <- pt %>%
  filter(year=="2011"&ticket_queue=="Paid") %>%
  filter(violation_code=="0964125"|violation_code=="0976170") %>%
  mutate(revenue=sum(total_payments)) %>%
  select(revenue) %>%
  head(1)

revenue_2012 <- pt %>%
  filter(year=="2012"&ticket_queue=="Paid") %>%
  filter(violation_code=="0964125C"|violation_code=="0964125B") %>%
  mutate(revenue=sum(total_payments)) %>%
  select(revenue) %>%
  head(1)

(revenue_2012-revenue_2011)*100
```


5.
After the increase, the repayment rate is 0.49.
Before the increase, the repayment rate is 0.54.
If the number of issued tickets stays constant, the revenue would increase by just 14.94%.

```{r}
#After the fine increase
pt %>%
  filter(year=="2012") %>%
  filter(violation_code=="0964125C"|violation_code=="0964125B") %>%
  count(ticket_queue) %>%
  mutate(all_ticket_issued = sum(n), repayment_rate = n/all_ticket_issued)
#Before the fine increase  
pt %>%
  filter(year=="2011") %>%
  filter(violation_code=="0976170"|violation_code=="0964125") %>%
  count(ticket_queue) %>%
  mutate(all_ticket_issued = sum(n), repayment_rate = n/all_ticket_issued)

#revenue change after increasing ticket cost from 120 to 200, if not started issuing more of these tickets.
(200*0.49-120*0.54)/120*0.54

```
6.

```{r}
map <- pt %>%
  mutate(sticker=str_extract(pt$violation_description, ".STICKER.")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(sticker)) %>%    
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(ticket_queue) %>%
  mutate(all_ticket_issued = sum(n), repayment_rate = n/all_ticket_issued) %>%
  filter(ticket_queue == "Paid") %>%
  select(ticket_queue,repayment_rate) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ungroup()

map %>% ggplot(aes(x=year,y=repayment_rate))+
  geom_line(group = 1)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = "2012"), color="blue")




```

7.
For 2010 and 2011, "EXPIRED METER OR OVERSTAY", "EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION" and "STREET CLEANING" have the most paid tickets, so I suggest we should 
increase the amount of fine on these tickets.

```{r}
pt %>%
  filter(year == "2011") %>% 
  filter(ticket_queue == "Paid") %>%
  count(violation_description) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  head(5)
  
pt %>%
  filter(year == "2010") %>% 
  filter(ticket_queue == "Paid") %>%
  count(violation_description) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  head(5)
  

```


8.
a.
Using tickets data in 2011, among the top 10 mostly paid tickets, the total amount of
tickets paid by high income neighborhoods is more than those by low income neighborhood for the following kinds of tickets:

EXPIRED METER OR OVERSTAY;
NO STANDING/PARKING TIME RESTRICTED;
REAR AND FRONT PLATE REQUIRED;
RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING;
RUSH HOUR PARKING;
STREET CLEANING

b.
About 62 million increase in revenue using number of tickets paid in 2011.
```{r}
pt %>% 
  filter(!is.na(median_income)) %>%
  distinct(zipcode,.keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(median=median(median_income))

pt <- pt %>%
  filter(!is.na(median_income)) %>%
 mutate(income_level = if_else(median_income > 30773, "high", "low"))


high_paid_tickets <- pt %>%
  filter(year == "2011") %>% 
  filter(ticket_queue == "Paid") %>%
  count(violation_description) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  select(violation_description) %>%
  head(10)

pt %>%
  filter(year=="2011") %>%
  filter(violation_description %in% high_paid_tickets$violation_description) %>%
  filter(ticket_queue == "Paid") %>%
  count(violation_description,income_level) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=violation_description, y=n, fill=income_level))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
  
pt %>%
  filter(year=="2011") %>%
  filter(violation_description %in% high_paid_tickets$violation_description) %>%
  filter(ticket_queue == "Paid") %>%
  count(violation_description,income_level) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = income_level, values_from = n) %>%
  filter(high>low) %>%
  summarise(increase_revenue = sum(high+low)*80*100)

```
